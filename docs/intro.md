# Introduction

The [React Use Audio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-use-audio) is a library for simple handling of sound.<br />
I implemented the sound playback feature using the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API),<br />I plan to extend the functionality based on the Web Audio API in the future.

## Key Values

### Easy to Use

React Use Audio focuses on providing an easy way to use it.<br />
Many developers aim to make it easy and simple to provide different sounds in the browser.

### Based on the Web Audio API

Implement functionality based on the <code>Web Audio API</code>.<br />
It's reliably maintained, and with so many references, <br />
you should be able to implement features quickly and easily.

### Based on React hooks

Make it easy to use through React hooks.<br />
In the future, we'd like to make it possible to handle various options through hooks.
